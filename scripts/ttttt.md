p1:

p2: outline
p3: general scenario & prob def
usually post-hoc: need examples
I/O bottlenecks: examples?

p4: posthoc vs in-situ

reduce io and postprocessing

p6: 3 goals
ascent, catalyst(not enough time)
performance tests

p7: 

p8: why conduit? explained

conduit-VTKm? what's the relation between the 2?

p10: rendering multiple perspectives --- ?? why do we need to visualize whole dataset in the beginning

p11: the big table
dumping raw data into storage -- hdf5 or csv?
vis: 5 fields every 10 time steps<1M particles, every 20 steps > 1M particles
2x24 cameras, 48 images per interval

p13:
what is baseline again? simu without data dump or vis
how do you measure execution time?
where did you run this simulation? what hardware configs?
- the timewise ordering of rendering and simulation?
miniHPC, 1 rank per node
